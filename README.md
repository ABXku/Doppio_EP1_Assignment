## Description
        [Doppio Tech](https://www.doppiotech.com) is the company providing software quality assurance. Also, they deliver courses related to software testing for free. The one that I learned is about basic robot frameworks and web automation, and at the end of the course, they give us an exercise to practice. After I finished this assignment, I just wanted to put it on GitHub to keep track of what I've been learning. By the way, if you are also interested in this [course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36g1al0qmdY&list=PL8a6U8OAfOwgA0wbqbtBJbY0nfczuwu4C&pp=iAQB) (in Thai), I highly recommend it! Thanks for a brilliant course.
